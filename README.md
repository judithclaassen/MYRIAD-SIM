# MYRIAD-SIM Code and Files

---

## Python Code

**MYRIAD-SIM** is implemented in Python. The code folder includes several scripts required to fit and run the model.

### Table 1. Code Files and Their Purpose

| File Name                   | Purpose                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bestfitdist.py`            | Fits the distributions for each variable in each grid for each month.         |
| `converttouniform.py`       | Converts the original data to uniform margins using best-fit distributions.   |
| `fitmodel.py`               | Fits the vine copula model to the different variables for each month.         |
| `runmodel.py`               | Runs the model to generate the synthetic data.                                |
| `converttouniformoutput.py` | Converts synthetic data from uniform margins back to the original data space. |

## Environment Setup

To run the code, set up a Python environment using the `myriadsim_env.yml` file. Follow these instructions:

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt**.
2. Navigate to the `MYRIAD-SIM` folder:

   ```bash
   cd 'insert path to your folder here'
   ```
3. Create the environment using:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f myriadsim_env.yml
   ```

## Training Data

The training data used for this model can be found in the `data` folder. This is also where the outputs of `converttouniform.py` are stored.

---

## Model Files

* The outputs of `bestfitdist.py` (fitted distributions for each variable) are saved in the `varpar` folder.
* The outputs of `fitmodel.py` (vine copula structures for each month) are stored in the `modelpar` folder.

## Output Files

The outputs generated by `runmodel.py` are stored in the `outputall` folder. This supplementary material includes an example of **three days**.
The **full dataset**, as described in the paper, is already publicly available on Zenodo:
